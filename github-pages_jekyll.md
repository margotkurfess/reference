# GitHub Pages and Jekyll

I used GitHub Pages and Jekyll to create [my personal blog](https://margotkurfess.github.io/). Here are some of the tools I found useful and some of my main learnings.

## Minimalist templates

I forked the repo [mmistakes/minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) as the basis for my site for a few reasons:

-	Clean, but not too simple. It is a nice light grey with a sidebar and sharing capabilities for posts. Plus the photo gets a little darker when you hover over it, which is a nice touch.
-	Easily customizable. It is really simple to add things to the sidebar such as links to social media and new pages with a number of layouts to choose from.
-	This is all made possible for someone new to websites by its [great documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Unless you are a whiz with html, css, and general website structure, I believe this is the single most important factor in picking a template.


There are a few other minimalist templates that I stumbled upon that could also be useful:
