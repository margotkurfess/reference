# Command Line

This documentation is to keep track of useful commands and resources for Command Line. I use PowerShell on Windows 10 at work and iTerm2 on my personal Mac.

## General resources

-	[Learn Command Line the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)
	
	This is actually an appendix for **Learn Python the Hard Way** and was extremely useful as a crash course on how to learn Command Line.

-	**Use Command Line!**
	
	Don't be lazy. I am just beginning to understand the benefits of using command line for as much as possible and it is so worth it. If you need to delete a file or move a folder (among many other things), try to use the command line.

## Setup

### Windows

I use PowerShell on my Windows 10 at work. It has taken some getting used to, but here are a few useful resources that have made things easier.

### Mac

There are generally more aesthetically pleasing ways of using the terminal on Mac (or at least I haven't found equivalents for PowerShell). There are a couple great articles on how to pimp out your Mac terminal experience.
